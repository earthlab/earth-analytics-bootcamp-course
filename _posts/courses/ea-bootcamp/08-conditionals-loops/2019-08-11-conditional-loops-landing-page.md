## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to Week {{ page.week }} of the Earth Analytics Bootcamp course! This week, you 
will write efficient `Python` code using `Jupyter Notebooks`. You will will implement 
another strategy for DRY (i.e. Do Not Repeat Yourself) code: conditional statements 
combined with for loops. 


## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing the lessons for Week {{ page.week }}, you will be able to:

* Explain how conditional statements help you to write DRY code
* Write `Python` code for conditional statements to run tasks only when certain conditions are met
* Create for loops to automate tasks
