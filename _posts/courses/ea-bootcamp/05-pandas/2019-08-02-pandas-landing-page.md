## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to Week {{ page.week }} of the Earth Analytics Bootcamp course! This week, you will write `Python` code and use the `pandas` package to import tabular data (.csv) as a `pandas dataframe`. You will then learn to summarize and manipulate `pandas dataframes`.


## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing the lessons for Week {{ page.week }}, you will be able to:

* Describe the `pandas dataframe` data structure 
* List key differences between `numpy arrays` and `pandas dataframes` 
* Write `Python` code to import tabular data (.csv) into `pandas dataframes`
* Write `Python` code to describe, manipulate, and plot `pandas dataframes`
* Write `Python` code to select data from `pandas dataframe` using indexing based on locations and values
